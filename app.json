    "description": "OpenEats is a recipe management site that allows users to create, share, and store their personal collection of recipes. The usage for the app is intended for a single user or a small group. For my personal use, I would be an admin user and a few (about 5-6) friends and family would be normal users. Admin users can add other users to the project (no open sign-ups), make changes to the available Cuisines and Courses, and add to the homepage banner. Normal users just have the ability to add recipes."
